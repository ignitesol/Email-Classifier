The following general purpose text classification algorithms have been implemented for the purpose of email categorization
* Bernoulli Naive Bayesian Method
* Maximum Entropy Method / Log-Likelihood Method

Both are ideal for classification of short-texts like emails, messageboards posts, short messages - usually text that is precise and to the point. Bayesian Method is supposed to be more robust and flexible, requiring less training; but it may not be as accurate as a well trained Maximum Entropy Method for multi-class classification. With enough training Maximum Entropy Method is expected and observed to have better prediction accuracy than Bayesian Method.

Tested and Validated on the following popular datasets:
* â€˜20 Newsgroups Dataset' - (Prediction Accuracy of 88% using Maximum Entropy Method)
* 'Enron Email Dataset' - (Prediction Accuracy of 91% using Maximum Entropy Method)

This classifier can be deployed as a webservice (using Flask) that supports training and classification using HTTP POST method.
